# Try Out Development Containers: Elixir

## Setting up Development
In order to setup the environment you need Visual Studio Code - Insider edition. The extension that we are going to use is currently in
preview and can only be added in Visual Studio Code - Insider. Once you have Visual Studio Code - Insider installed, look for the Remote - Containers extension.

Press F1 to pull up the Command Palette, type or select "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...". Open the vscode-remote-try-elixir folder. It will start building the docker container and mounting the folder to the container. 

## Container Terminal
You might need to type in a command into the container using the terminal. If you don't see the terminal pane, go to View menu and select Terminal.

The red box shows the terminal pane, and the yellow pane shows the select box which you need to click on the drop down menu and select the bash option.
